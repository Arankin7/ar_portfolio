            About Anthony

            <h3>The story so far</h3>
            <p>
                Since he was a young boy Anthony has been a dreamer.  Before the age of ten he was making trips to radioshack to purchase motors, cables, and tools to build toys.  He wanted to grow up to be an inventor. By the time he became a teenager, he realized becoming an inventor wasn't as easy as he though.  He then turned his eye to music.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In elementary school Anthony joined the school band and learned to play the alto saxaphone.  Though he greatly enjoyed playing in band, by the time middle school rolled around, he'd lost interest in the saxaphone, there was a new musical instrument that he fell in love with.  At the age of 12 Anthony got his first guitar. 
            </p>
            <p>
                From the age of 12 and up till his mid twenties music was the center of Anthony's life.  He learned to love the technical aspects of music, playing in obscure time signatures and practicing advanced techniques on the guitar.  He would eventually switch from the electric guitar to playing exclusively fingerstyle acoustic.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout all of his musical endeavors, Anthony always maintained additional hobbies.  Aside from learning magic tricks, juggling, and speedcubing his main time sink was playing video games.  Though he never put much thought into playing video games, there was much more under the surface than he realized.  He learned to appreciate the soundtracks more and more as he aged, and he appreciated the immense amount of work that was put into these complex games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Somewhere around his mid twenties Anthony started to imagine what it would be like to make games.  Surely it couldn't be all that tough?  Anthony did research periodically and stumbled across the Unity game engine one day.  Having prior experience in school with photoshop and other kinds of media editors, Unity didn't seem all that foreign to him.  Now just to climb that daunting mountain known as programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the years Anthony dabbled in learning C# so he could build a game of his dreams. He watched hours and hours worth of tutorials, read through a few books, and turned game design into his main focus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately for Anthony, work still had to be the number one focus for him.  He did have bills afterall, and having forgone college in favor of working full time he had to work extra hard to make ends meet. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Though just a dream to him, Anthony really enjoyed his side hobby of learning to program objects and manipulate data. He would throughout the years do some research into colleges and programs that offered coding classes.  But work always came out on top. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, after years of hesitation and deliberation, he pulled the trigger and enrolled into a coding bootcamp.  Though he wasn't developing video games, he was still learning the core fundamentals of programming, and honing his craft.
            </p>
            <h3>
                What's next?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Anthony plans to continue learning web development and making side projects.  Now with a formal education he can finally put his passion of building things front and center.    
            </p>
            <p>
                Ideally, Anthony would love to see him in the role of game developer, whether employed by a company or as an indie developer.  To hone his skills and repetoire he hopes to become a full stack web developer shortly after graduating from the coding bootcamp.
